# Smart Surveillance: Object Detection & Telegram Notifier

A real-time object detection system that leverages YOLOv5 to identify specific objects (like people, cats, dogs, and cars) from a live camera feed and sends instant notifications, along with a captured image, to a Telegram chat. The system also includes a Telegram bot that can receive images from users.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Continuously monitors a live camera feed for predefined objects.
- **YOLOv5 Integration**: Utilizes the powerful YOLOv5 model for accurate and fast object recognition.
- **Configurable Target Classes**: Easily specify which objects you want to detect (e.g., person, cat, dog, car).
- **Intelligent Notification System**: Sends Telegram notifications only after a specified interval to prevent spam.
- **Image Capture & Sharing**: Saves detected object frames with bounding boxes and sends them directly to your Telegram chat.
- **Telegram Bot Interaction**: A Telegram bot that can receive images from users and provide a simple acknowledgment.
- **Easy Setup**: Minimal configuration required to get started.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system operates with a straightforward architecture, designed for real-time processing and efficient notification.

### Conceptual Flow:
1. **Camera Feed**: The system continuously captures frames from a connected webcam.
2. **Object Detection (YOLOv5)**: Each captured frame is fed into the pre-trained YOLOv5 model.
3. **Filtering & Analysis**: The model's detections are filtered to identify only the `TARGET_CLASSES`. A time-based debounce mechanism prevents excessive notifications.
4. **Image Capture**: If a target object is detected and the notification interval has passed, the frame (with bounding boxes drawn) is saved locally.
5. **Telegram Notification**: A message, along with the captured image, is sent to your configured Telegram chat ID.
6. **Telegram Bot Listener**: Separately, the Telegram bot listens for incoming messages, specifically photos, and responds accordingly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get your Smart Surveillance system up and running.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- A webcam connected to your system.
- A Telegram account.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-surveillance.git
cd smart-surveillance
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
_(You'll need to create a requirements.txt file based on the provided code. It should contain: opencv-python, torch, ultralytics/yolov5, python-telegram-bot, python-dotenv.)_

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project:
```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
CHAT_ID="YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID"
```

#### How to get YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN:
- Open Telegram and search for @BotFather.
- Start a chat with BotFather and send /newbot.
- Follow the instructions to choose a name and username for your bot.
- BotFather will provide you with an API Token. Copy this token and paste it into your .env file.

#### How to get YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID:
- Start a conversation with your newly created bot in Telegram.
- Send any message to your bot.
- Open your web browser and go to:
```bash
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates
```
- Look for the chat object in the JSON response. The id field within this object is your CHAT_ID. Copy this ID and paste it into your .env file.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Once everything is set up, you can run the main script:
```bash
python your_main_script_name.py
```

### What to Expect:
- A window titled "Object Detection" will appear, displaying the live camera feed with bounding boxes around detected objects.
- When a TARGET_CLASS object is detected, and the DETECTION_INTERVAL has passed, a notification and an image will be sent to your Telegram chat.
- You can press `q` on the "Object Detection" window to quit the application.
- You can send images to your Telegram bot, and it will acknowledge receipt.

---

## üîß Customization

You can easily customize the detection behavior by modifying the following variables in the script:

- **TARGET_CLASSES**: A list of strings representing the object classes you want to detect.
```python
TARGET_CLASSES = ['person', 'cat', 'dog', 'car']
```

- **DETECTION_INTERVAL**: The minimum time (in seconds) between sending notifications for new detections. This prevents notification spam.
```python
DETECTION_INTERVAL = 5  # seconds
```

- **Camera Selection**: If you have multiple cameras, you might need to change `cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)` to `1`, `2`, etc., to select a different camera.

---

## üí° Future Enhancements

- **Customizable Notification Messages**: Allow users to define their own notification message templates.
- **Multiple Camera Support**: Extend to monitor multiple camera feeds simultaneously.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a simple web interface for configuration and viewing detection history.
- **Cloud Storage**: Option to upload captured images to cloud storage (e.g., Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3) instead of local storage.
- **Advanced Alerting**: Integrate with other notification services (e.g., email, SMS).
- **Time-based Scheduling**: Allow users to schedule when the detection system should be active.
- **Motion Detection Pre-filter**: Use basic motion detection to trigger YOLOv5 inference only when movement is detected, saving resources.
