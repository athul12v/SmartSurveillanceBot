# Next-Gen Smart Surveillance | Real-Time Object Detection + Telegram Alert System

A sleek, real-time surveillance system built with **Streamlit** and **YOLOv5**, enabling live object detection through your webcam. It captures images of detected objects (like people, cats, dogs, cars) and sends instant alerts with snapshots to your Telegram chat ‚Äî all wrapped in an intuitive, responsive web UI that looks and feels like a smart surveillance console.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Detection with Webcam**: Monitor live video feed and detect objects continuously.
- **YOLOv5 Model Integration**: Utilizes the fast and accurate YOLOv5s pre-trained model.
- **Configurable Target Objects**: Detects multiple objects, focusing on key targets like people, cats, dogs, and cars.
- **Telegram Notifications with Cooldown**: Sends image alerts to Telegram only after a cooldown period to prevent spamming.
- **Captured Image Storage**: Saves cropped detected object images locally with timestamped filenames.
- **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard**: Start/Stop monitoring with clear UI feedback, live video display with bounding boxes, and alert messages.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Handles webcam connection issues and Telegram notification failures gracefully.
- **Easy Setup & Deployment**: Lightweight dependencies and minimal configuration for quick start.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Workflow:

1. **Start Monitoring**: User clicks the button to open the webcam feed.
2. **Frame Capture & Detection**: Frames are read in real-time and passed through YOLOv5.
3. **Object Filtering**: Only detections above confidence threshold and matching target classes are processed.
4. **Bounding Box Overlay**: Detected objects are marked visually on the live feed.
5. **Image Capture & Notification**: When a target (e.g., person) is detected and cooldown elapsed, a cropped image is saved and sent via Telegram.
6. **Stop Monitoring**: User can stop the feed to release resources gracefully.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A webcam connected and accessible
- Telegram account and bot token

### Steps

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/athul12v/smart-surveillance.git
cd SmartSurveillanBot
```

2. **Create & activate virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Example requirements.txt includes:*

```
streamlit
torch
opencv-python
requests
```

4. **Configure environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in project root:

```env
BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
CHAT_ID="YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID"
```

5. **Run the app**

```bash
streamlit run your_script_name.py
```

Open the URL printed by Streamlit in your browser to interact with the smart surveillance UI.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Guide

* Click **Start Monitoring** to begin object detection via webcam.
* Watch the live feed on the dashboard with bounding boxes drawn.
* Receive Telegram alerts with images whenever your target objects are detected.
* Click **Stop Monitoring** to safely close the webcam and stop processing.
* Alerts won‚Äôt spam thanks to cooldown timers between notifications.
* Clear on-screen messages will inform you of detection status or errors.

---

## üîß Customization Options

* **Target Classes**: Change or add classes in the code (`'person'`, `'cat'`, `'dog'`, `'car'`).
* **Confidence Threshold**: Adjust minimum detection confidence (currently 0.5).
* **Alert Cooldown**: Modify cooldown seconds (default 30s) to tune notification frequency.
* **Camera Source**: Change the camera index in OpenCV capture for multiple webcams.

---

## üí° Future Enhancements

* Add multi-camera support and switch camera feeds dynamically.
* Integrate motion detection as a pre-filter to optimize resource usage.
* Implement alert history and dashboard analytics.
* Allow configuring notification message templates via UI.
* Store captured images to cloud for remote access.
* Support additional notification channels like email or SMS.
* Enable scheduling and automatic start/stop times.
